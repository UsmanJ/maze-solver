# Maze Solver

## Synopsis

This application allows you to input a maze structure along with a start point (x,y) and returns the solution to the maze via an API call.

This application is split into two parts, client side, and server side. Both need their dependencies to be installed individually and run individually.


## Technologies Used

* NodeJS
* Express
* React
* Redux


## Build & development

After cloning the repo, go into the `./server` and `./client` folder of the project and:

* Run `npm install`

* Run `npm start`

This will run the client and server on different ports but both will be able to speak to each other.
